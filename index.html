        <p>Welcome to my personal website!</p>
        <p>I am currently studying Data Science at the University of Michigan College of Engineering with a minor in User Experience Design. I have spent four semesters as an intern at Siemens Digital Industries Software in various development-focused roles. My passion is using my creative skills and my technical knowledge to solve real-world, complex problems. People have described me as being creative, passionate,, and hard-working. In my free time, I enjoy fishing, hunting, and being outdoors!</p>
